00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,290
Welcome back. In this section
of Rediscovering JavaScript,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,819
I want to talk about editor features
that we should be using

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,240
because they just make total sense.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,219
We've always been very excited
that you just need a text editor

5
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,650
to write JavaScript
or even a command line if you wanted to.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,770
But we have so many great tools these days
that make our life so much easier

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,820
and allow us to write predictable code,
maintainable code,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,400
because the editor itself
has features in there for us.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,200
For this example, we're going
to use Visual Studio Code,

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,710
which is an open-source editor by Microsoft.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,620
You can also use Atom,
you can use all kinds of other editors.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,640
Most frameworks 
will have their own editors.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,940
A lot of the features that we have
in these editors are the same

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,680
for all of these different tools.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,060
So I just want to talk about
some of the features that you

16
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,240
might not have seen yet in these.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,090
Not all of them are JavaScript-based.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,739
Some of them will also
talk about HTML and CSS.

19
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,670
But as JavaScript is used
together with those technologies,

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,040
it does make sense
to think about them as well.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,560
Now you get Visual Studio Code
by just going to code.visualStudio.com

22
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,810
And you can download it there.

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,890
You can download it for Mac,
Linux, or Windows,

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,790
so it's a cross-platform,
open-source, free editor

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,530
that you can just install on your machine
and it runs automatically from there.

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,190
It updates itself as well,
and you can sign in for, like,

27
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,580
getting the developer preview
if you want to really get excited about it.

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,920
There's also extensible documentation
about the editor itself, what it means,

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,383
how to use it, what kind 
of features are coming,

30
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,640
what kind of features it has 
for node.js and for JavaScript,

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,380
how to debug them, and how the feature sets
for different environments that you want to have.

32
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,220
These are constantly getting updated
and you can also edit them if you want to.

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,130
If you find something wrong in this documentation,
please edit them and send it back to the team

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,620
and you get features from that.

35
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,760
Now, a first thing to remember here,
or what's very important,

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,420
is that it's called Visual Studio Code,
but it's got nothing to do with Visual Studio.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,430
Visual Studio is an IDE, that is,
most of the time,

38
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,620
for me as a JavaScript developer
overkill for what we're doing.

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,769
It has its benefits, of course,
for using in other languages.

40
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,989
It's a very great development environment.

41
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,609
But it's not Visual Studio.

42
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:17,200
So you don't need to worry about it
being a Microsoft product.

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,879
"You have to do everything with Microsoft."

44
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,049
This is an open-source product
that is maintained by Microsoft people

45
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,040
but also people from 
the outside take part in that.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,740
So a few things that I want to point out
that editors have nowadays that I think

47
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,240
are much more exciting
than what we had in the past.

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,960
First thing you see here is a colour scheme.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,159
And this already helps me
in my code to see what is what.

50
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,579
So this is the document query selector,
and this here is a value, for example.

51
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,879
So you see in your code what is what.

52
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,730
That allows you to easily skim through
your code and understand what you're doing

53
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,889
rather than just having a black text
on white background

54
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,740
or white text on black background,
that you need to understand what is what.

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,660
The next thing these editors do
which is pretty amazing for you

56
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,029
is that you can change these to your needs.

57
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:11,151
So if you need, for example, a bigger font,
then you can change the font to it –

58
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:14,069
if you want a different font face,
you can have a different font face.

59
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,590
All of these things are tweakable.

60
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,980
So you can make this thing your
editor the best way you want to have it.

61
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,620
There's lots of settings in there.

62
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,230
There's lots of people writing their own themes.

63
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,650
There's a whole community around theming
of different editors and moving the theme

64
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,449
from one editor to another.

65
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,589
But all of these things are meant for you
to make your code more readable to yourself

66
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,069
and more readable to the next person
that has to maintain your code,

67
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,980
which actually might be 
you in the near future.

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,859
The next thing that I love 
about editors nowadays

69
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,019
is that they do automatically 
things for you like indenting.

70
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,559
Like, for example, when you have
a new function here called "myFunction,"

71
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:57,390
and you do the brackets, you see that it
already indented into the next line,

72
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,650
that way making your code
much, much more readable.

73
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,370
There are automated settings there
and you could copy and paste a function in

74
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,040
or a piece of code in and it lays it out
for you the way you're supposed to do it.

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,260
And that's pretty powerful, 
because in the past,

76
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,389
you had these these complaints

77
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,150
about one person using space,
one using one using tabs.

78
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,290
In this case, you can just define down here
if you want spaces or tabs

79
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,940
and you can change them around
to convert from spaces to tabs

80
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,170
and you can do the automated
indentation in this code for yourself.

81
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,570
So while you're writing code,
the syntax of the code,

82
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,450
or the look and feel of the code
is done for you by the editor, which, of course,

83
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:45,050
makes it much, much easier to be maintainable
and to make your code much more readable.

84
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,120
And you can concentrate 
on writing your code

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,900
rather than styling 
your code accordingly to that.

86
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,200
There are all kind of
interesting features there as well,

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,180
like when you have something like
an addEventListener here,

88
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,470
you can do a Command+D 
to highlight all of them.

89
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,530
And as you can see,
we now have different cursors here.

90
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,940
So, instead of having one cursor,
you now have a cursor after each of them.

91
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,660
So if you want to rename all of them
to something else, you can do that

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,980
by just hitting delete and
renaming it to something else.

93
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,610
So that way, you don't have to do that
bit by bit and keep repeating things.

94
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,900
And when we repeat things, we make mistakes.

95
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,400
So this way, an editor helps you much,
much better to find out what's going on.

96
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,360
Autocompletion is something that
most editors have for you nowadays as well.

97
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,780
And this is very, very useful
because it does two things.

98
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,470
First of all, it makes sure
that you don't mistype things,

99
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,630
and second of all,
you type a lot less.

100
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,270
And a lot less typing means you can
write more code in less time,

101
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,580
and you also have 
less strain on your fingers.

102
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,680
So for example, if I want to rewrite
that first line here, I start with a restart button,

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,820
and it realised already
I've got a restart button defined.

104
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,460
So all I have to type is rest or all the 
other things that might be applicable to it.

105
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,350
So then, I just hit the tab completion,
and I have a restart button.

106
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,360
I then start the addEventListener,

107
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,820
and in this case, I could also 
take the addEventListener

108
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,420
and highlight it, and that way,
I learned what add event listener means.

109
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,560
If I don't remember, for example,
the order of the parameters in this one

110
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,270
or I don't know what kind of features
are available to me – so in this case

111
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,860
is point up, touch start, point to cancel,
and so on and so forth,

112
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,940
I now know what these things are

113
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,860
just by clicking on them and
getting an autocompletion form yourself.

114
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,900
So this is what a good editor does for you
and it makes it much, much simpler

115
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,700
to write a lot more code 
without doing any typos.

116
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,860
Now if you have a huge amount of code –
this is not too much of a huge amount of code.

117
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,030
It's just a simple game that I've written –

118
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,360
you can see that a good editor 
has these maps here as well.

119
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,800
So you can jump in
the map itself to a certain part

120
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,460
rather than just 
having to do it line by line.

121
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,700
So that's a nice little shortcut to jump
to a section in the code as well.

122
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,820
And it gives you an overview of, like,
how large the code is that you've written so far.

123
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,740
Another interesting thing is when you
have a big amount of code,

124
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,950
you sometimes wonder what something is
that you call and where it is.

125
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,220
So for example, I've got a
function here called "clearMove."

126
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,580
And it says here,
"Okay, does it define constant clearMove?"

127
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,240
And if I click on that one,
I can say "Peek Definition,"

128
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,280
and that way I can see where
the function is in the other part of the code.

129
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,930
So I don't have to scroll back and forth
between the two sections

130
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,710
to understand what I'm doing.

131
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,520
So I can just do this with a Ctrl+F12
or with a mouse here, and that way,

132
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,560
I can actually understand where I am.

133
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,389
So I can see this code is here,
the other code is here.

134
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,400
So I would have had to jump around
in the whole document just to do that peeking.

135
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,460
So these are some things 
that are very, very powerful

136
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,060
to do in here when it 
comes to writing JavaScript.

137
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,980
Other things that a good editor
should do for you is also allow you

138
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,960
to have several editors next to each other.

139
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,560
So in this case, I can split that here,
and I can have my HTML next to my JavaScript,

140
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,260
so I see how both of those interact
and I can jump between them.

141
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,440
One extra feature that 
something like Visual Studio code has

142
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,030
is that it has the whole environment 
that we talked about earlier –

143
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,639
the debugging and the console –
directly in one editor.

144
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,930
So you don't need to jump between the terminal
and the editor all the time because you have

145
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,870
an inbuilt terminal in the system here.

146
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,876
So I could just do my commands –

147
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:31,260
my build commands or my 
version controlling commands –

148
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,413
directly in the editor 
without having to jump

149
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,220
between the terminal 
and my editor all the time.

150
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,080
Sometimes, it's a good thing to jump between
the two because you're changing your mind.

151
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,509
But it also is quite heavy 
on your cognitive thinking

152
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:46,680
to go from one editor to another,

153
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,495
where it's like, if you stay in this one,

154
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,389
you can do all the commands 
that you need to do here,

155
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:54,170
so you can do your version controlling,
you can do your build scripts,

156
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,329
and all of those could 
(ought) to be automated.

157
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,800
So every time I save 
something in the editor,

158
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,089
it would do automatically part of my build
script

159
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,110
or part of my deployment for me.

160
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,160
So that way, you have everything in one editor.

161
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,809
This is also great if you teach people
something about web development,

162
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,680
you can just give them this one editor
rather than saying like,

163
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,309
"You need an editor, and you need to set up
your terminal, you need to install your terminal that way."

164
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,529
Another thing that it does is linting.

165
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:25,220
So if, for example, you have your CSS here,
and I've got a linter installed,

166
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,180
if I have it show the problems,
it should tell me when something goes wrong.

167
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,000
So you can see here – now I have
a semi-colon that I deleted.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,539
And all of a sudden, the 
background here becomes red,

169
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:38,220
and I've got squiggly lines 
under those things.

170
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,149
That's much like when you do a typo in Word,
it does it now inside the code.

171
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,779
So in this case, I forgot the semicolon
which is now an error here,

172
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,340
It's "semi-colon expected."

173
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,880
And then the rest of the CSS selector
is also broken because the semi-colon isn't there.

174
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,639
So if I now put the semi-colon in there again,
then all of these errors are going away.

175
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,680
So that way, I get insight directly,
while I'm coding that I'm doing something wrong,

176
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,639
rather than having to go to the browser,
debug it and find my problems that way.

177
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,000
You can do the same thing in JavaScript
by either installing an extension

178
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,660
or you can also use –

179
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,730
just do a comment above 
your JavaScript called //@ts-check

180
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,119
That one uses TypeScript's linter
to run your JavaScript against.

181
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,619
So in this case, it now shows me 
all the JavaScript errors

182
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:25,029
that I made in this one, 
and some of them

183
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,050
are actually not really errors,
but they're false positives.

184
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,990
But if I made some mistake,
it will automatically tell me that.

185
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,290
So for example, if I deleted that game here,
and I tried to access the game somewhere else,

186
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,820
it says cannot find game.

187
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,249
So in this case, I have 
not defined the game,

188
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,920
so I cannot actually do 
a game turns because they don't exist.

189
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,780
That would be an error that the browser
would throw at me, and I would have to debug there.

190
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,360
But as I have to linter turned on 
in the editor itself,

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,709
it shows me the things 
while I'm coding it,

192
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:58,050
and that way, I become a better developer
because I don't make mistakes.

193
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,470
You also see the red dots here.

194
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,910
These are telling us where all
the problems are that we just talked about.

195
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,680
So some of them have these issues
and you roll over the squiggly line,

196
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,660
and then it tells you what the problem is.

197
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,320
The last thing that is great in this editor
is that it has version controlling built in.

198
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,939
And we're going to talk 
about version control later.

199
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:20,790
So when you change something
and you click on it, you can actually see

200
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,930
the differences in your merging.

201
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,970
So in this case, if I want to send this back
to the server, it tells me now that these

202
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,660
new two lines have been added,

203
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,420
and these two lines
have been deleted,

204
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,010
and the game thing 
has been changed here as well.

205
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,680
So I get – before I send something
to the server or to my colleagues,

206
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,800
it tells me all the things that happened.

207
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,240
So in essence, a good editor 
should tell you –

208
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,369
should make it, first of all,
easy for you to write,

209
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:48,670
by having a nice theme and making it easier
to type things by having autocompletion

210
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,250
and the indentation and these things for you.

211
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,730
And the extra bits that I love 
about Visual Studio Code

212
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,470
and others as well is that 
it has the terminal built in,

213
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,490
it has the linting built in, 
and it tells me

214
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,819
when I'm doing something wrong

215
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,180
while I'm doing something wrong
rather than me having to find out by trying it

216
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,800
in the browser and then breaking it.

217
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,500
So think about setting up
your editor for yourself.

218
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:12,809
And if you choose to use a Visual Studio Code,
you know it's an open-source editor

219
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:14,369
and it will not go away.

220
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,819
And that's a great thing too.

221
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,930
So now you know how a good editor
can make you a better developer.

222
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,620
And finding the extensions for it is actually
something to make it your editor as well.

223
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,399
Next, I want to talk about something
that is very important when you want to work

224
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,920
with a lot of other people
and also when you want to make sure

225
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,580
that what you've done today
is understandable in three weeks time,

226
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,740
and that's version controlling.

227
