00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:02,649
Welcome back to
Rediscovering JavaScript.

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:05,570
This time, I want to talk about
how our development environment

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,910
changed over the last few years
and some of the things you might not

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,959
be using already but you should
to make yourself much more effective.

5
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:15,289
There's always a bit of a
weird thing telling people, like,

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,090
"You need to learn this to be more
effective and feels like a lot of work".

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,099
But some of the things I'm going to
show you right now are so common

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,330
and are so useful that it actually
makes no sense not to use them.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,560
We were always super-excited
as JavaScript developers that all we needed

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,540
was a text editor and the browser
to execute our JavaScript in.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,410
This has changed with JavaScript
now being different than it was before.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,040
And also the environments that
we use have changed immensely.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,410
The first thing to think about
is how browsers have changed.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,980
Browsers are not the black holes
any longer where we don't know

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,400
what's happening and how much
support they have for JavaScript.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,800
It's also almost impossible nowadays
to turn off JavaScript in a browser.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,400
It was much easier for users
back in the day to do so.

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,100
But we have a problem in browsers
nowadays as people that have add-ons

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,700
like ad blockers and these kind of things
that might block your JavaScript.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,800
But as users themselves,
people are much more okay

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,800
with JavaScript being active in the
browsers and most of them don't even know it.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,500
All browsers are nowadays evergreen,
so they're actually coming up every two days,

23
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,380
every two weeks, every month,
sometimes it's up to three months

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,820
for a new version to come out.

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,240
But it's not like the four or five years
that we used to have between different versions

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,090
of Internet Explorer, and people didn't upgrade.

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,109
So upgrading their browsers is much,
much easier than it used to be,

28
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,090
and that means, for us as
JavaScript developers,

29
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,720
we have new features to play with.

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,880
Every browser also comes
with developer tools built in.

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,069
So this, for example – here's Firefox.

32
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,049
And if I type the inspect element,
I can see I've got my HTML editor,

33
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:47,880
I've got a debugger where
I can debug my JavaScript

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,749
and we're going
to come back to that later.

35
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:51,130
I've got style editors.

36
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,280
I've got all kinds of network insights
and performance insights for my applications.

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,820
And I have a console in there.

38
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,950
So if you want to just try out
some JavaScript, you can use that

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,359
to actually write JavaScript
and do like: 3 + 2

40
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,740
which is math, not JavaScript.

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,720
But JavaScript editor
now shows you this is 5.

42
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,640
The next thing that browsers have –
all of them have developer tools.

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,390
So there's Firefox, of course,
with the Firefox tools.

44
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,330
There's Chrome with the
Chromium dev tools,

45
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,580
which probably are the ones

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,230
that are the most
sophisticated ones at the moment.

47
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,360
Edge has the F12 Dev Tools
which are much better than people think

48
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
because we haven't looked at them for years.

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,310
And even Safari has some
really good developer tools in there.

50
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,840
But you need to turn it into
a developer mode first

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,580
to show these developer tools.

52
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,280
Mobile browsers don't necessarily
have developer tools,

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,110
but a lot of them allow you to connect
from your desktop to your mobile phone

54
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,240
to debug the browser
in these developer tools as well.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,710
So all browsers over the last few years
have become not only ways

56
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,480
to display and execute JavaScript
but also development environments

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,320
to build JavaScript in
and to write JavaScript in.

58
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,420
The next step that we have
is that we replaced the normal text messaging

59
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,360
or the text editors that we have
with more sophisticated editors.

60
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,900
We're going to go into detail later on
as to what that means

61
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,710
and what benefits a good editor
has for you, but suffice it to say,

62
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,410
a lot of them are hackable
and that's the best thing about them.

63
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,570
These editors are written in languages
that we can write ourselves –

64
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,840
we can extend them with extensions
or we can write – be part of the main code

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,840
because all of them are open-source.

66
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,650
So our development environments,
our editor environments have become

67
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,970
ways for us to contribute
rather than just hoping that an editor

68
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,430
will have a certain feature
and us jumping from editor to editor

69
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,560
and having to learn all the different features
of them to become more effective in using them.

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,060
The next thing that a lot of people
are afraid of and wondering why

71
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,240
we should be using it is the terminal.

72
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,320
The terminal, in this case here –
it's now indistinct on my OSX machine

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,370
or on my Windows machine,
I've got the Ubuntu shell as well –

74
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,190
is basically a UNIX shell.

75
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,700
So it's going back to 1970's technologies
and we always, as JavaScript developers,

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,680
wondered why we would ever need this.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,040
People who wrote server-side technologies
like Java, PHP, Perl were much more efficient

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,900
in those things and used to know them already.

79
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,040
We didn't think there was a necessity there.

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,490
With Node, that changed.

81
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,030
Node is JavaScript 
that runs on the server side,

82
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,329
so everything you need to know

83
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,319
and you need to run Node in
happens in the terminal.

84
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,710
That also means that a lot of JavaScript tools
like build processes, package managing,

85
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,680
and so on and so forth
happens in the terminal itself.

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,460
So it's a good skill to have.

87
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,139
It's not too hard to learn the terminal.

88
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,419
It feels a bit weird at times
and sometimes you do a Node request

89
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:40,900
and you get, like, five screens
of random error messages

90
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,400
and you don't know what's happening,
but don't get discouraged by that.

91
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,150
What you can do in the terminal
and what you do as a JavaScript developer

92
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,610
in the terminal is use build tools,
use these scripts, use Node environments,

93
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,569
but also do your version controlling,
and we're gonna have a special in-depth video

94
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,960
later on on version controlling
and what it means to you

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,130
and why it's a beneficial thing.

96
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,020
So the terminal is 
something good to know.

97
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,740
It's not necessary
you have to be an expert in it.

98
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,360
But there's lots of good
training materials out there.

99
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,770
And if you just start, for example, Node,
you can run Javascript in your in your terminal

100
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,150
as well here, and you can get out of it
by pressing Ctrl+C two times.

101
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,180
So you will not be an expert
in the terminal overnight.

102
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,430
But it's something that you should be
thinking about because far too many good things

103
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,419
are happening in the terminal these days –

104
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,040
which is pretty bizarre
because it goes back to 1970's technology

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,479
when you think about it.

106
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,850
One other thing that we've 
been using in the past

107
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,449
has been libraries and frameworks.

108
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,580
And, of course, there are
new frameworks every week.

109
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,389
All of them make our lives easier,
all of them are much better than plain JavaScript,

110
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,919
and some of them really,
really make a difference.

111
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,509
So be excited about them, look into them,
but always, always be aware

112
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,659
that being an expert in one version
of one framework for this month

113
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,539
might be an amazing skill set,
but in half a year's time,

114
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,760
it might not be a thing
that you need any longer.

115
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,319
So, to me, frameworks and libraries
are things that make our life easier

116
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,740
and are sometimes necessary
or sometimes really good for project work.

117
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,389
But being an expert in only one
of them might actually be a problem

118
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,870
in the near future if you're not flexible
enough to jump between frameworks

119
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,610
from time to time as well.

120
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,310
And knowing the underneath
technologies in JavaScript,

121
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,580
the language features that allow
these libraries to be what they are,

122
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,939
is a good skill set to have because then
you become independent of the library

123
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,979
that you want to and you just use
JavaScript and the library for the benefits

124
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:34,789
that it was written for.

125
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,780
The last thing I'm really excited about –
and I think a lot of people should use more

126
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,460
are online editors 
or like playgrounds.

127
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,110
This is JSBin here, for example.

128
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,310
And JSBin is an opportunity for you
to write JavaScript, CSS, and HTML,

129
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,610
and execute it directly in the browser.

130
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,210
So in this case when I now have a div here
and I want to do something with it,

131
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,840
so in CSS, I can say the div
should be a background colour green,

132
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,560
and give it a width and height.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Then while I'm doing it, I already see
that there is a green div here right now.

134
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,520
And in JavaScript, I can now get
a reference to that.

135
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,420
And then you can say -

136
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,259
And if I use that one now 
and I should run it,

137
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,610
then something should happen,

138
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,584
run with JS, and it turns
it into the other width,

139
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,840
although, in the CSS, 
it has a width of 10 pixels.

140
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,460
These things are great
to try things out quickly

141
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,360
without having to set up anything
on your computer yourself.

142
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,220
Others, like CodePen also have
all kinds of, like, pre compilers in there.

143
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,300
So if you want to use SASS
or you want to use a lot of libraries like Vue.js,

144
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,550
or React without installing any of it,
these are great ways to try these things out.

145
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,849
They're also collaborative.

146
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:14,250
So other people can make a copy
of what you've done and change it around

147
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,110
and do something with them.

148
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,960
So there's three things 
you can do with those.

149
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,309
Play with things, try them out, ask for help,
so when you have something that doesn't work

150
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:27,180
in your code, write a little demo
in one of those things and send that link around,

151
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,800
so people can actually edit them for you
or edit them with you collaboratively,

152
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,380
and then you can find the problem together
without having to describe what your problem is.

153
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,460
So these are great tools for teaching,
these are great tools for learning,

154
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,660
and these are great tools for just
collaborating with other people.

155
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,360
And when you use the preprocessors
and the settings that you can do

156
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,279
in these JavaScript tools here
where you can have all kind of precompilers

157
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,720
and all kind of different engines
that you can use, it means you don't have

158
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,810
to set up your computer, it means
you don't have to mess with your environment,

159
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,470
you just have something online
that you play with and if you like it,

160
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,120
then you can start 
setting up your machine.

161
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,810
And this is where JavaScript
changed from the past.

162
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,149
We now have a whole ecosystem
of development tools to work with.

163
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,300
So to repeat, browsers are evergreen
and all of them come with developer tools,

164
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,959
so we should use these developer tools
and understand what their benefits are

165
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,700
rather than putting alerts or console logs
everywhere everywhere in our code.

166
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,960
Libraries and frameworks help us
to do things that are not as easy to be done

167
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,509
in native JavaScript, if you just
want to have something simply done,

168
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,460
they're probably a good idea,
but it might be dangerous to only rely on them.

169
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,100
Editor's are much better than the text editors
of the past because all of them are now integrated,

170
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,800
they're open, they're extensible,
and you can write code in them for them.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,400
And online tools like JSBin and CodePen
are a great opportunity for you to try things out

172
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,580
without messing up your own computer
and to send things to other people

173
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,470
to collaboratively work on them.

174
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,790
So these are just a few of the things
where JavaScript works.

175
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,490
And the terminal is the last one where
we do a lot of, like, version controlling

176
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,620
and tooling in JavaScript itself.

177
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,860
Knowing all of these is quite a hassle
or is quite a job, but it will make you

178
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,019
much more effective, and you don't
need to be an expert in all of them.

179
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,070
You just need to try them out when
you need them and find some information online.

180
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,779
And that's what I wanted to talk
to you about in this video.

180
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,000
