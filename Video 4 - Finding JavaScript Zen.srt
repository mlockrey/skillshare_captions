00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,620
Welcome to this video in the
Rediscovering JavaScript series.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,650
In this section, I want you
to remember that JavaScript is huge

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,390
and there's all kind of things
that are done with JavaScript.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,730
So you shouldn't feel bad

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,090
if you feel overwhelmed looking
around what people are doing with it.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,140
You should also not feel bad
that other people are better at it

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,720
because other people do different things.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,659
So when it comes to using
JavaScript these days,

9
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:26,069
it's not about knowing everything.

10
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:29,519
That's almost impossible to do
because the different ways JavaScript

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,500
are implemented around the web
and around technology stacks

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,699
ask for different ways of learning
JavaScript and different ways of using it.

13
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:40,129
So something that makes
sense in an old environment

14
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,260
does not necessarily make sense
on the web and the other way around.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,940
So if you're a JavaScript developer
that just wants to use vanilla JavaScript,

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,180
basically, JavaScript without
any add-ons, without any features,

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,280
without any datasets around it
or toolsets around it,

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,860
MDN Web Docs is where
you're actually gonna be living.

19
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,719
This is where you find the information,
and this is where you find excitement,

20
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,860
and this is probably a community
where you also want to join

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,600
and you also want to be part of.

22
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,920
So there, you can shine, there,
you can give your information back,

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,190
and there, you can do what you're
actually excited about and what you can do.

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,300
If you're more inclined to use JavaScript
in a way to build proper software services

25
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,430
or servers or these kind of things,

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,410
then the Node world is where
you're much more excited.

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,080
These different worlds in JavaScript
all have their different communities,

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,050
have their different Slack channels,
have their different events,

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,910
and have their different 
community gatherings.

30
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,260
So sometimes you're standing
as a web developer at a Node event.

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,090
You don't understand a single word.

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,450
Whereas like a Node developer
goes to a design conference

33
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,130
and doesn't understand what people
are excited about when they do so many

34
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,560
different things in JavaScript
in the Node environment.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,180
So make sure that you find
a spot that you're excited about

36
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,170
and then concentrate on that one.

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,480
But don't look at the others
who are doing things in different ways

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,600
and think that they're doing it wrong.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,930
They're just doing it 
differently than you do.

40
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,060
There's also nothing wrong
with taking a different approach

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,880
to developing by using a library.

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,070
React is a huge community
and a huge environment

43
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,700
also based on JavaScript,

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,310
but React itself is a language
that does things completely differently

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,970
than browsers do it
and vanilla JavaScript does it.

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,670
This doesn't mean that you're
actually giving up on the course,

47
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,450
that you're actually not
becoming a JavaScript developer,

48
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,320
it means that you're taking a shortcut
or you're taken away to build bigger applications

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,680
different applications –
on a different stack.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,300
So look at these things and look around
where you will find yourself interested.

51
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,960
You can stay with the vanilla JavaScript world
and build everything yourself,

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,110
you can go to a server-side environment
with Node, or you can use Vue.js, Angular,

53
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,100
or React to build applications in that stack,

54
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,140
much like we used to have people
writing things in jQuery rather than JavaScript

55
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,600
because jQuery back then solved
the problem of browser differences.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,150
React and Vue and Angular
and those solve other problems

57
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,300
by putting architectural ideas
of software development

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,170
into the JavaScript space.

59
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,720
So none of these things
should a barrier for you.

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,400
None of these things
should make you feel bad.

61
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,340
But understand that if you're
a JavaScript expert,

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,400
you will probably not
understand React from the get-go.

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
You have to put effort in 
and learn it that way.

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,500
The same way with Vue.js.

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,900
A lot of designers like Vue.js
because it's much easier than vanilla JavaScript.

66
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,810
Because every time we talk
about vanilla JavaScript,

67
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,959
we talk about all the exceptions
that you have to worry about.

68
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,490
With Vue.js, a lot of these things
have been evened out for you

69
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,660
so you can start developing
something pretty and beautiful

70
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,600
simpler than by
understanding the language itself.

71
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,480
So think about JavaScript again
as a "pick and mix", as something

72
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,980
where you can go and you don't
have to play in all these communities –

73
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,080
but you should pick one of them
and become excited in those.

74
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,570
So I hope you feel a bit calmer
and you have a bit of a Zen feeling

75
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,910
about JavaScript right now
knowing that you don't need to play

76
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,910
in all the parts and understand
everything that's going on around you.

77
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,819
In the next video, we're going to talk
about the development environment

78
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,520
for JavaScript, which changed drastically
from just being a text editor in a browser.

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,810
So I want you to understand
where to play, what to do, and what to install.
