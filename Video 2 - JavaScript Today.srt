00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello and welcome to
the Rediscovering JavaScript course.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,400
Today, we want to talk about what
JavaScript is and what it has become.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,160
The problem with JavaScript
is that it's always been a thing

4
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,570
that a lot of people wanted to do

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,600
and only a few people have been
very enthusiastic about.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,000
You probably have been dabbling
with JavaScript or you've been writing JavaScript,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,369
but most of the time
you will have used other people's code.

8
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,519
When JavaScript came around,
it was just something that we added into websites

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,900
and we learned by looking 
at other people's code.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,419
The view source was our teacher
and we actually looked at what was going on,

11
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:34,489
copied and pasted code from somebody else,

12
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,480
changed a few numbers around,
hoped nothing broke,

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,740
and then we actually had a
JavaScript that was our own.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,100
This has changed a lot.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,109
If you've been using JavaScript
for quite some while and you go back

16
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,000
into the world right now
and you realise that people talk

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,559
about things like NPM,
like Node, like Webpack,

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,660
the language seems to be
much more complex than it used to be.

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,760
It used to be more like Java,
Ruby, or these kind of languages.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,300
And I want you to understand that
this is normal and this is a normal evolution

21
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:06,100
and you don't have to 
feel inadequate about it,

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,780
you don't have to feel worried about it,

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,000
it just means that the 
versatility of JavaScript itself

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,300
made it possible for it to go 
in two different directions.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,240
So when you become a JavaScript developer
nowadays, you could be anything.

26
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,799
You could be just a web developer

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,020
that does some beautiful things
on websites with JavaScript,

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,780
you could be a Node developer
who builds servers, API's, micro-services,

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,240
all these kind of cool things,

30
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:32,700
or you could be even 
a hardcore app developer

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,320
that builds something like
Slack or Atom in the JavaScript,

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,560
HTML, and CSS, and then
packages it up as an application itself.

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,720
Now if you think back what 
JavaScript used to be,

34
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,270
you will get into a lot 
of resources online

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,300
that are very, very outdated
and very very dangerous to learn nowadays.

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,180
Take for example w3schools here,
which is always the first result in Google

37
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,380
when you google
something random in JavaScript.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,600
It teaches you a lot of ways how JavaScript
used to be back in the days

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,980
and and some of the JavaScript syntax
that was back in the days.

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,360
But a lot of this JavaScript is not how
you write things nowadays anymore.

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,480
As somebody who's been 
using these resources for years,

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,800
we have a few hang-ups 
that we should get rid of.

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,960
One of the hang-ups is that browsers
will always be terrible

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,713
and browsers will always be in our way

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,180
and not supporting the 
things that we want to do.

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,540
Another hang-up is that our end users
will not upgrade their environments

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,500
and will have a problem with 
new features that we want to have.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,420
We should free ourselves from
these hang-ups and from these fears,

49
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,280
and that's why we need new resources
to learn JavaScript and to find new information.

50
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,060
So if you want to look up something nowadays
in JavaScript, there's a a few resources

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,580
I want to quickly go 
through with you to play with.

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,820
These are the things where 
you should always go to

53
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,620
if you want to find out something new,

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,260
and they're always up to date
because they're community driven environments.

55
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,868
So when JavaScript 
became a thing,

56
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:02,300
a lot of people stopped 
writing JavaScript itself

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,340
because browsers were problematic –

58
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,130
like Internet Explorer, Netscape,
whatever, Firefox, later on Opera.

59
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,120
All of them had different ways of dealing

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,020
with the language because the language
was not properly standardised as well.

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,240
And we had no web standards
before that time as well.

62
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,360
When the web standard movement came around
and HTML5 became a thing, that changed drastically.

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,340
Our resources nowadays,
our browsers nowadays are standards-based

64
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,450
and agree with each other
what different technologies should be used

65
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,880
and what becomes a standard
and what doesn't.

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,720
We don't have to run after the innovation
of browser makers anymore

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,920
and do things for one browser
and differently for another browser.

68
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,660
And that is a wonderful thing.

69
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,140
One of the main things 
that people used to do

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,310
is use jQuery instead of JavaScript

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,140
because jQuery helped us
to level the playing field,

72
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,970
to actually give the browsers
the same experiences,

73
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,180
and we didn't have
to think about these anymore.

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,480
But nowadays, browsers are so good
and the standards have been going so far,

75
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,750
that you most likely don't need jQuery anymore
because you're actually adding extra code

76
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,018
for an environment 
that doesn't exist anymore

77
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,480
and for browsers that 
shouldn't be in use anymore.

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,100
The first resource I want 
you to get excited about

79
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,960
because, I'm very excited 
about it, is called caniuse.com.

80
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,760
caniuse.com is a resource site

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,540
that tells you what 
browsers can do these days

82
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,260
and which browsers support
which feature in what format.

83
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,420
The most common use case
for caniuse.com is that you will go there

84
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,100
to find about support for something,
say for example, the fetch API.

85
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,480
Once you type that in, you already get
the results telling you what fetch is,

86
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,380
a modern replacement 
for XMLHttpRequest,

87
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
and which browsers support it.

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,720
You can also see the red browsers
that don't support it

89
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,700
and sometimes there are yellow browsers
that support it but have problems.

90
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,920
Once there are any problems,
it will be listed with known issues here

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
where you can work around them.

92
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,860
In this case, we don't have any.

93
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,660
But other features might have them.

94
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,300
So you know where the problems are,
when they will be fixed, and what's happening.

95
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,280
The other thing that for 
every feature that you look up,

96
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,790
you will have a resources tab here

97
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,240
that show you about the specification,
having a demo, going for polyfill,

98
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,280
and then have the different platforms

99
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,720
like Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome,
Firefox, and WebKit, and seeing when

100
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,320
they have been shipping it or what
the problem with the status is right now.

101
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,900
So, if you always wonder 
about having a new feature

102
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,840
that somebody's excited 
about and you wonder

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,760
if you can use it in 
your products with your end-users,

104
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,020
this is a great resource to look at.

105
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,100
It's continuously maintained.

106
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,840
All the browser makers are giving feedback
to the maintainers of this product.

107
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,700
So this is where to learn if it's safe to
use something

108
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,030
and also get excited about using it.

109
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,500
If you want to know about 
the language JavaScript itself –

110
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,340
So that's for the hardcore 
nerds about JavaScript –

111
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,120
the TC39 ECMA group is actually 
the people who write the language.

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,620
This is the consortium
or this is the technical committee

113
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,660
that creates the next 
version of that language

114
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,120
and maintains the current 
version of that language.

115
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,420
So this is the main source
for the language itself,

116
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,700
not some other resource
that might be saying, like,

117
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
we know JavaScript.

118
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,510
These are the people who make it.

119
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,850
If you want to look up something in JavaScript,
and you want to go and see, like,

120
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,630
"How does something work?"

121
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,040
The MDN Web Docs, to me,
are the best resource.

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,389
They're not the best resource
because I used to work for Mozilla,

123
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,480
but this is because where 
all the browser makers

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,980
realised they should 
put their information.

125
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,980
The MDN Web Docs is an open wiki.
So you can edit it, you can you can take part

126
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,110
in this community as well, and you will –
and you will see features that get updated

127
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,890
much faster than any 
other resource out there.

128
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:42,160
So if you look up something like,
for example array map, in this case,

129
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,040
you will not only get 
an example of what it is,

130
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,920
but you will get all kinds 
of information about what it means.

131
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,600
So it explains to you that the map method
creates a new array with the results

132
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,290
of calling a provided function
and so on and so forth.

133
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,280
You can run these examples live here,
you can then reset them to undo them as well,

134
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,180
and then you get detailed information
about the syntax of it, how to use map,

135
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,680
and how to use the callbacks.

136
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,840
You have a listing of the specifications
explaining what different things mean,

137
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,860
and you also have 
a browser compatibility table

138
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,610
listed in here which is, weirdly enough,

139
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,290
coming from caniuse.com.

140
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,860
So these two sites are tightly linked.

141
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,460
So this information will always
be up-to-date as well.

142
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,160
If you want to know about the different browsers
and how they work with JavaScript,

143
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:28,169
you're in luck as well.

144
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,380
Back in the days when I started
as a JavaScript developer,

145
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,480
these were black holes.

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,640
Nobody knew what was coming,
nobody knew what was going on.

147
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,990
Nowadays, all browsers have resources
and even Twitter accounts

148
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,300
where you find new 
information about them.

149
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,880
This is the Microsoft one for Edge.

150
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,130
For Chrome, there's a Chromium blog,

151
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,580
for Safari, there's the WebKit blog,

152
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,990
for Firefox, there's, 
of course, the Firefox blog,

153
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,750
and for others, like 
Samson browser, Opera browser,

154
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,960
all browser makers are very open to developers,

155
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,940
to talk to them and go for it.

156
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,610
So these are some
of the resources to look at

157
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,770
when you want to start working
with JavaScript nowadays.

158
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,910
These are up-to-date resources,
editable resources, where you can take part

159
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,100
and you can make them 
better if you want to.

160
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,180
Don't just randomly Google 
for problems in JavaScript,

161
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,700
then copy and paste the code,

162
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,040
take those resources and learn JavaScript
from the makers of JavaScript

163
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,060
and from the implementers of JavaScript
and you will be a much happier developer.

164
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,380
