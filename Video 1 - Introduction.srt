00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,480
Hello. I'm Chris Heilmann.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,500
I'm from Berlin, Germany and I've been
a web developer for over 20 years.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,560
And ever since we had JavaScript,
that was one of my passions.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,460
I wrote a few books about it,
I did a lot of trainings on it,

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,400
and today, I'm going 
to share some of that with you.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,580
I'm very excited that our web community
has become so big that you can go to Meetups

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,680
or conferences almost every week â€“
and that's what I do.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,820
I give a lot of keynotes,
I give a lot of trainings,

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,680
and I interview in companies
and with companies,

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,720
what they want to do
with the newest technologies.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,320
That includes machine learning,
artificial intelligence,

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,520
and also good old web development
with JavaScript and other languages.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,060
This course is for people who want
to understand JavaScript

14
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,280
and want to use it now
and are kind of overwhelmed

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,829
by all the offers that are there
and the fragmentation

16
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,080
of the learning materials
that are out there.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,320
So, if you're somebody
who's just starting with JavaScript,

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
that's for you as well.

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,920
Or if you're somebody
who's been doing JavaScript

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,200
but feels like there should be more,
that's for you as well.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,719
It's a good overview of what
the JavaScript space is doing nowadays

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,400
and what you can do with the language,

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,860
and it's much more than 
it used to be in the past.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,660
All of the materials and all of the products
we're going to talk about in this course

25
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,790
are web-based and open-source,
so you can work with them across platforms.

26
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,190
You don't need to have a Macintosh.

27
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,880
You don't need to have a Windows machine.

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,340
You can use whatever you want.

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,360
I don't want to tell you 
what environment to use

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,150
and what environment to set up.

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,920
Instead, you should find the one
that makes you most comfortable.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,190
So, nothing here is something
that you need to buy because open-source

33
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,220
helps us be much better as developers.

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,120
I hope you find something
that will excite you and you will become

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,820
a better JavaScript developer
after the end of this course.

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,120
So let's get going.

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,840
